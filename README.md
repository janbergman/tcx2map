* Upload map and GPS track through the hidden menu on the left.
* Two point align: Roughly adjust the track to the course by clicking on a control ring and then clicking on its position on the map. Do the same for another control as far away from the first as possible.
* Fine-tune the rest of the controls by left-clicking and dragging the ring to the right place on the map. If you change your mind, you can click again.
* Extra points can be added by clicking anywhere on the track. It is marked with a blue ring that can then be dragged to the right place. If you change your mind, you can click again.

Note: the rings are a bit hard to see, so it may be a good idea to zoom in a bit when adjusting.

When you are finished, you can save as a .png file.
